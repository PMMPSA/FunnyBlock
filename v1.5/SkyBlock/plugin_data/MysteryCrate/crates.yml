# HUGE THANKS TO @DaPigGuy and his PiggyCrates plugin for making multiple crates possible.
#
# Disclaimer: Some part of this code has been taken from @DaPigGuy's plugin,
# I have asked his permission to use his code as a reference before hand as to avoid
# unnecessary complains and/or contradictions.
#
# To reward the player with a command make sure that the meta of the reward is same as
# commandMeta set in config.yml or else the command won't work.
#
# Example on how to set the config.
# Note: Please use tabs instead of spaces.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# example:               | Set the name of the crate.
#  drops:                | List the items that can be received from the crate.
#   - name: "G-Helmet"   | Custom name for the item. Use "ยง" for adding colors.
#     id: 1              | ID of the reward.
#     meta: 0            | Meta or Damage value of the Item.
#     amount: 1          | The amount of Item that player receives.
#     enchantments:      | Set enchants for items here. Both VanillaEnchantments and PiggyCustomEnchants are supported.

#         level: 3       | The level for enchant.
#       unbreaking:      | You can set multiple enchants as long as they are registered.
#         level: 2       | NOTE: If you donot want enchants simply remove the enchantments heading.
#     lore: "USE ME"     | Add a custom lore to the reward. Use "\n" for next line.
#     commands:          | Add commands to execute when player wins a reward. Multiple commands supported.
#     - "say hi"         | Use \"%PLAYER%\" to insert player name (with the quotes and slash).
#     - "say test"       | Don't forget to mention the maxCommands in config.yml.
#  block: "911:0"        | Set the block ID you want the crate to represent. Placing a chest on it will activate the crate.
